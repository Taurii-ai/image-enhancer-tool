# URGENT DEPLOYMENT NEEDED

⚠️ CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT TIMESTAMP: 2025-08-15T04:00:00Z ⚠️

🚨 VERCEL AUTO-DEPLOY BROKEN - MANUAL INTERVENTION REQUIRED 🚨

## BREAKING CHANGES WAITING:
- 🎨 NEW LOGO: User's exact image implemented
- 💳 NEW STRIPE API: /api/simple-checkout.js endpoint  
- 🔍 DEBUG ALERTS: Visible error tracking added
- 🚀 UI CHANGES: "v2.0 🚀" added to header
- 🔧 API REBUILD: Complete Stripe payment overhaul

## DEPLOYMENT STATUS:
- ❌ GitHub webhook to Vercel appears broken
- ❌ Auto-deploy not triggering despite commits
- ✅ All code changes ready and committed
- ⚠️ MANUAL DEPLOYMENT REQUIRED IN VERCEL DASHBOARD

## ACTION NEEDED:
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Click "Deploy" manually 
3. Or reconnect GitHub integration in Vercel settings

These changes WILL work once deployed - the auto-deploy connection is the only issue.
